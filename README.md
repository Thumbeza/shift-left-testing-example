# Projects
* Shift.Left.Testing.Poc - this is a simple api project for doing methametical functions. all the business logic to be tested will reside within this project..
* Shift.Left.Testing.Poc.Tests - this is the unit test project that the software engineers must use to test the smallest modules of code, and ensure that they work as expected at the smalles unit.
* Shift.Left.Testing.Poc.e2e.Tests - this is the black box testing project for ensuring that the api works end to end as expected. The QA Engineers must use this project to add any relavent (black box) tests for any code changes that warrants. Tests in this project should be added (if applicable) as part of the pr process before the pr can be approved and merged. This ensures that only code that has been extensively tested is merged to the main branch.
